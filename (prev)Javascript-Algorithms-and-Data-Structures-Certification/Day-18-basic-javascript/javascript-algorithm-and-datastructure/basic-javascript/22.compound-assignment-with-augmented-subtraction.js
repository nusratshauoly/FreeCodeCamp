/*
Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

myVar = myVar - 5;
will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

myVar -= 5;
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.

Tests
Waiting:a should equal 5.
Waiting:b should equal -6.
Waiting:c should equal 2.
Waiting:You should use the -= operator for each variable.
Waiting:You should not modify the code above the specified comment.

let b = 9;
