/*
Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication
The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.

myVar = myVar * 5;
will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar *= 5;
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator.

Tests
Waiting:a should equal 25.
Waiting:b should equal 36.
Waiting:c should equal 46.
Waiting:You should use the *= operator for each variable.
Waiting:You should not modify the code above the specified comment.
