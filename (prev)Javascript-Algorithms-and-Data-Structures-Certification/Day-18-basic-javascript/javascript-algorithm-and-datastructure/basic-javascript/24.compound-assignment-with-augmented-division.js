/*  
Compound Assignment With Augmented Division
The /= operator divides a variable by another number.

myVar = myVar / 5;
Will divide myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar /= 5;
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator.

Tests
Waiting:a should equal 4.
Waiting:b should equal 27.
Waiting:c should equal 3.
Waiting:You should use the /= operator for each variable.
Waiting:You should not modify the code above the specified comment.
