/* Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript
We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

Example

const myVar = 12 - 6;
myVar would have the value 6.

Change the 0 so the difference is 12. */

const difference = 45 - 33;
console.log(difference);


const subtraction = 20 - 10;
console.log(subtraction);
