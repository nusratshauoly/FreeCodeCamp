/*
Nest one Array within Another Array
You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

Create a nested array called myArray.

Tests
Waiting:myArray should have at least one array nested within another array.

// Only change code below this line
const myArray = [["Nusrat", 25], ["Syed", 30]];
console.log(myArray);
